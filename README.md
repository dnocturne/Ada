# Ada 👠

Ada is a Discord bot designed for specific purposes and specific communities, this is not meant as a replacement for every discord bot you've ever seen or had. Also means that I wrote this for myself and that my code sucks. The code is primarily just to keep for myself, but I don't mind other people seeing it either way.

## Important Note ❗

Ada is coded and made for a few Lithuanian communities. I don't have an interest in making the discord bot multilingual or English. If you wish to add English support with libraries such as i18next or anything else. Make a Pull Request. Plenty of various tools exist to translate text from Lithuanian to English.
